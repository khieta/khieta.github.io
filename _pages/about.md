Hi! My name is Kesha and I'm a graduate student in [Computer Science at the University of Maryland](https://www.cs.umd.edu/). I'm part of the [PLUM group](https://plum-umd.github.io/) and advised by [Mike Hicks](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/). I'm interested in **programming language design**, **program analysis** and **formal verification**, with a special focus on the application area of **quantum computing**. 

I did my undergraduate in [Computer Science at the University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/cs).

Over the course of my graduate career, my primary project has been designing and implementing **SQIR**, a small quantum intermediate representation embedded in the Coq proof assistant, and **VOQC**, a verified optimizer for quantum circuits.
* We presented SQIR and VOQC at *POPL 2021*. See our full paper at [arXiv:1912.02250](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02250.pdf).
* We presented a follow-up paper on using SQIR to verify quantum programs at *ITP 2021*. See our full paper at [arXiv:2010.01240](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01240.pdf).
* Our code is available at [github.com/inQWIRE/SQIR](https://github.com/inQWIRE/SQIR).

In my free time, I enjoy include painting, pottery, and spending time with my three cats. My husband, [Thomas Rolinger](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas_Rolinger), is also a graduate student in Computer Science at UMD.
