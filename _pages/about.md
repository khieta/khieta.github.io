Hello! My name is Kesha, and I'm an Applied Scientist in the Automated Reasoning in Identity Group at Amazon AWS.
I'm interested in **compilers**, **program analysis** and **formal verification**.
I got my PhD in 2022 in [Computer Science at the University of Maryland](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), where I was advised by [Mike Hicks](https://mhicks.me/). 
I did my undergraduate in [Computer Science at the University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/cs).

For my dissertation, I designed and implemented SQIR, a *small quantum intermediate representation* embedded in the Coq proof assistant, and VOQC, a *verified optimizer for quantum circuits*. You can learn more about SQIR and VOQC in [this blog post](https://blog.sigplan.org/2021/06/02/verifying-a-quantum-compiler/), or you can check out [my dissertation](../files/drafts/khieta-dissertation.pdf).

In my free time, I enjoy include puzzles, painting, and spending time with my three cats and husband, [Thomas Rolinger](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas_Rolinger).
